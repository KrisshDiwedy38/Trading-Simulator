Project: Quantitative Trading Simulator 

Overview
   Develop a quantitative trading simulator that uses statistical arbitrage to identify trading opportunities in a simulated or real-world financial dataset. This project will showcase your expertise in programming, math, and finance, and your ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

Key Features
   Market Data Integration:
      Using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch historical and live market data.

   Data Preprocessing & Analysis:
      Perform cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
      Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations, price trends, and statistical anomalies.

   Forecasting Approach:
      Using the ARIMA model for time series forcasting.

   Performance Metrics:
      Track performance with metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized returns.
      Compare your strategy against benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500).

   Clean, Modular Codebase:
      Develop a well-documented, modular system that others can easily understand and extend.
      Use Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

   Future plan:
      Using Sentiment analysis to quantify relevent and trusted new articles along with competitors stocks to predict stocks with greater accuracy.
      Implementing Deep learning model to improve the accuracy to complete with the industry models
