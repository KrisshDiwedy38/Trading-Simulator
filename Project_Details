Project: Quantitative Trading Simulator 

Overview
   Develop a quantitative trading simulator that uses statistical arbitrage to identify trading opportunities in a simulated or real-world financial dataset. This project will showcase your expertise in programming, math, and finance, and your ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

Key Features
   Market Data Integration:
      Using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch historical and live market data.

   Data Preprocessing & Analysis:
      Perform cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
      Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations, price trends, and statistical anomalies.

   Forecasting Approach:


   Performance Metrics:
      Track performance with metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized returns.
      Compare your strategy against benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500).

   Clean, Modular Codebase:
      Develop a well-documented, modular system that others can easily understand and extend.
      Use Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

   Future plan:
      Using Sentiment analysis to quantify relevent and trusted new articles along with competitors stocks to predict stocks with greater accuracy.
