Project: Quantitative Trading Simulator with Statistical Arbitrage

Overview
   Develop a quantitative trading simulator that uses statistical arbitrage to identify trading opportunities in a simulated or real-world financial dataset. This project will showcase your expertise in programming, math, and finance, and your ability to apply these skills to solve real-world problems.

Key Features
   Market Data Integration:
      Use APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl to fetch historical and live market data.

   Data Preprocessing & Analysis:
      Perform cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas.
      Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize correlations, price trends, and statistical anomalies.

   Statistical Arbitrage Strategy:
      Implement a pairs trading strategy:
         Identify pairs of stocks that are co-integrated (using cointegration tests).
         Detect deviations from their historical relationship and generate buy/sell signals.
      Use techniques like mean-reversion and Z-score analysis.

   Machine Learning for Signal Optimization (Advanced):
      Train models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict the likelihood of profitable trades.
      Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means clustering) to group similar assets.

   Algorithmic Trading Execution:
      Simulate order execution with realistic constraints (e.g., transaction costs, slippage).
      Optimize portfolio allocation using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) or Kelly Criterion.

   Performance Metrics:
      Track performance with metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and annualized returns.
      Compare your strategy against benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500).

   Clean, Modular Codebase:
      Develop a well-documented, modular system that others can easily understand and extend.
      Use Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

Deliverables
   Report or Presentation:
      Document the methodology, findings, and performance analysis.
      Include visualizations of trading signals, backtest results, and portfolio performance.

   Code Repository:
      Host the project on GitHub, showcasing clean, well-commented code.
      Include a detailed README file with setup instructions and explanations.
   
   Deployment (Optional):
      Create a web interface (using Flask/Django or Streamlit) to showcase the strategy in action.
